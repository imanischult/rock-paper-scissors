# rock-paper-scissors

This is your classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, basic web version! 

I put coding down for a few months while sharpening my Program Manager skills, and decided to introduce coding slowly by practicing vanilla JavaScript. This application is a basic Javascript-HTML web application. It is meant to practice writing reusable code, understand and manipulate the DOM, and use elementary logic to solve a problem. 

Feel free to explore this application to grab a better understanding of my writing style!
